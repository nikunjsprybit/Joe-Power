Help for demo import - http://help.wprentals.org/#!/demo_content

We can do this for free for each client. For support please open a ticket at http://support.wpestate.org/

----------------------------------------------------

If you wish to have the green icons from demo - you can install the child theme included in this demo1 folder.


1. Import separately post, pages, owners, properties

If you choose to import only post, pages from demo, you will import only text (not images). If you need images, import full demo (please note you need a good hosting service to upload all content at once)

---

2. Import full content

Note that this file is large because we include all images from the demo, which are in high resolution. If during the import you receive an error from the server, it means you're hosting is limiting the size or the upload speed of your account.

In this case, try to repeat the import several times, until all content si live.

3. How to import

Go to Tools - Import and activate the Import Plugin

Select the files you wish to import from demo_content folder

Wait until you get the "All done. Have Fun!" Message

4. What to do after import

a. Install the plugins that come with the theme from the header Notice.

NOTE: If you have problems installing the plugins - it means there is a conflict with your server and 
the plugin auto-installer.
 
Solution: Go to Plugins. Add New and add each of the plugins zips from wprentals/libs/plugins

Note 2: you can choose not to use the plugins. They are included, but not mandatory.
If you don't wish to use the features that come with these plugins only (offered by plugins developers). 
Our shortcodes are avaialble in wordpress editor as well.

b. Go to Appearance - Menus - Select "Footer" menu as Footer Menu, Main Menu as Primary and Mobile Menu.

NOTE: the video is not with commercial license. if you wish to buy the license to use this video on your site you must buy 
the license from http://videohive.net/item/holiday-on-a-summer-beach-in-a-hammock/10401924

Install & Activate Revolution Slider

Import video.txt

c. Set Theme Slider properties

Go to Theme Options - Theme Slider and Select properties that show in the slider.
Featured images for these Theme Slider are 1920px wide and same height.

d. Set featured images for Taxonomy Pages - City and Area.

Wordpress doesn't know how to import images for each city and area. 
So you will have to add these images again if you wish to use them from Edit City or Edit Area

Notes:

During import WordPress adds UNIQUE and different IDs to posts, properties, categories, cities, areas, owners. 
All shortcodes that are not showing need to be edited and the ID must be set as in your theme import.

To see IDs easier - install Reveal Id Plugins - https://wordpress.org/plugins/reveal-ids-for-wp-admin-25/

Then edit the page shortcodes and add your own content IDs.

Properties must be assigned to users/owners registered in front end, but import will not be able to do that.
For that reason owner info will not be showing for properties.
Create user in front end and assign property to new user/owner.
 

NOTE about Users/Owners.

Users/Onwers cannot be imported by wordpress and synced. The demo users/owners will not show correct name on Property page for this reason. Your new users and submissions from front end will display correctly.



5. Sidebar, Footer and Top Area widgets -

Sidebars widgets arrangement is not imported by WordPress. You must manually add what widgetts you wish to each widget area.

Create your own sidebars with available widgets
Edit pages and assign sidebar created.
Edit footer widgets.
